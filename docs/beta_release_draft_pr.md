# Beta Release Draft Pull Request

## Overview
This draft PR merges recent beta preparation changes from `feature/beta-release` into `feature/alpha-completion` to align the alpha integration branch with the latest CI, workflow, and release process improvements.

## Changes Included
1. Workflow Token Updates
   - Replaced deprecated `GITHUB_TOKEN` usage with `PROJECT_TOKEN` per new GitHub token naming restrictions.
   - Ensured consistent secret reference across `release.yml` and `renovate_prune.yml`.
2. Release Workflow Adjustments
   - Fixed environment variable configuration for release publication.
   - Maintained prerelease logic for alpha/beta/rc tags.
3. CI Stability Improvements
   - Prior earlier commits (already merged previously) included action version pinning for reproducibility and security.
4. Docker Build Reliability
   - (Previously merged) Improvements to locate and package the `dlv` binary reliably in multi-arch builds.
