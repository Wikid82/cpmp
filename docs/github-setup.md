# 🔧 GitHub Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up GitHub Actions for automatic Docker builds and documentation deployment.

---

## 📦 Step 1: Docker Image Publishing (Automatic!)

The Docker build workflow uses GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) to store your images. **No setup required!** GitHub automatically provides authentication tokens for GHCR.

### How It Works:

GitHub Actions automatically uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` which has permission to:
- ✅ Push images to `ghcr.io/wikid82/caddyproxymanagerplus`
- ✅ Link images to your repository
- ✅ Publish images for free (public repositories)

**Nothing to configure!** Just push code and images will be built automatically.

### Make Your Images Public (Optional):

By default, container images are private. To make them public:

1. **Go to your repository** → https://github.com/Wikid82/CaddyProxyManagerPlus
2. **Look for "Packages"** on the right sidebar (after first build)
3. **Click your package name**
4. **Click "Package settings"** (right side)
5. **Scroll down to "Danger Zone"**
6. **Click "Change visibility"** → Select **"Public"**

**Why make it public?** Anyone can pull your Docker images without authentication!

## 📚 Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages (For Documentation)

Your documentation will be published to GitHub Pages (not the wiki). Pages is better for auto-deployment and looks more professional!

### Enable Pages:

1. **Go to your repository** → https://github.com/Wikid82/CaddyProxyManagerPlus
2. **Click "Settings"** (top menu)
3. **Click "Pages"** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")
4. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
5. That's it! No other settings needed.

Once enabled, your docs will be live at:
```
https://wikid82.github.io/CaddyProxyManagerPlus/
```

**Note:** The first deployment takes 2-3 minutes. Check the Actions tab to see progress!

## 🚀 How the Workflows Work

### Docker Build Workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`)

**Triggers when:**
- ✅ You push to `main` branch → Creates `latest` tag
- ✅ You push to `development` branch → Creates `dev` tag
- ✅ You create a version tag like `v1.0.0` → Creates version tags
- ✅ You manually trigger it from GitHub UI

**What it does:**
1. Builds the frontend
2. Builds a Docker image for multiple platforms (AMD64, ARM64)
3. Pushes to Docker Hub with appropriate tags
4. Tests the image by starting it and checking the health endpoint
5. Shows you a summary of what was built

**Tags created:**
- `latest` - Always the newest stable version (from `main`)
- `dev` - The development version (from `development`)
- `1.0.0`, `1.0`, `1` - Version numbers (from git tags)
- `sha-abc1234` - Specific commit versions

**Where images are stored:**
- `ghcr.io/wikid82/caddyproxymanagerplus:latest`
- `ghcr.io/wikid82/caddyproxymanagerplus:dev`
- `ghcr.io/wikid82/caddyproxymanagerplus:1.0.0`

### Documentation Workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)

**Triggers when:**
- ✅ You push changes to `docs/` folder
- ✅ You update `README.md`
- ✅ You manually trigger it from GitHub UI

**What it does:**
1. Converts all markdown files to beautiful HTML pages
2. Creates a nice homepage with navigation
3. Adds dark theme styling (matches the app!)
4. Publishes to GitHub Pages
5. Shows you the published URL

---

## 🎯 Testing Your Setup

### Test Docker Build:

1. Make a small change to any file
2. Commit and push to `development`:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: trigger docker build"
   git push origin development
   ```
3. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
4. Watch the "Build and Push Docker Images" workflow run
5. Check **Packages** on your GitHub profile for the new `dev` tag!

### Test Docs Deployment:

1. Make a small change to `README.md` or any doc file
2. Commit and push to `main`:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "docs: update readme"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
4. Watch the "Deploy Documentation to GitHub Pages" workflow run
5. Visit your docs site (shown in the workflow summary)!

## 🏷️ Creating Version Releases

When you're ready to release a new version:

1. **Tag your release:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **The workflow automatically:**
   - Builds Docker image
   - Tags it as `1.0.0`, `1.0`, and `1`
   - Pushes to Docker Hub
   - Tests it works

3. **Users can pull it:**
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/wikid82/caddyproxymanagerplus:1.0.0
   docker pull ghcr.io/wikid82/caddyproxymanagerplus:latest
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Docker Build Fails

**Problem**: "Error: denied: requested access to the resource is denied"
- **Fix**: This shouldn't happen with `GITHUB_TOKEN` - check workflow permissions
- **Verify**: Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Read and write permissions" enabled

**Problem**: Can't pull the image
- **Fix**: Make the package public (see Step 1 above)
- **Or**: Authenticate with GitHub: `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin`

### Docs Don't Deploy

**Problem**: "deployment not found"
- **Fix**: Make sure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source in Pages settings
- **Not**: "Deploy from a branch"

**Problem**: Docs show 404 error
- **Fix**: Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment completes
- **Fix**: Check the workflow summary for the actual URL

### General Issues

**Check workflow logs:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click the failed workflow
3. Click the failed job
4. Expand the step that failed
5. Read the error message
